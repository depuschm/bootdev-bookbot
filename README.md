# bootdev-bookbot
Guided project "Build a Bookbot" from boot.dev:
https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot-python

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Adding Books

Before running main.py create a folder "books" in the same directory.
In this directory you can add your books as text files.
Add your first book:

- [Frankenstein](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/41445/pg41445.txt)

(copy and paste everything into a "frankenstein.txt" in the books directory)

More books you can add
- [Moby Dick](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt)
- [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1342/pg1342.txt)

You can download more books from Project [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

## Program

The Python program can be run with "python3 main.py <path_to_book>".
It will print a report of words and characters for the specified book.
