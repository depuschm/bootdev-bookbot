# bootdev-bookbot
Guided project "Build a Bookbot" from boot.dev:
https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot-python

BookBot is my first project! (not really, but the first guided project on boot.dev)

## Adding Books

Before running main.py create a folder "books" in the same directory.
In this directory you can add your books as text files.
Add the first book from:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt

(copy and paste everything into a "frankenstein.txt" in the books directory)

## Program

The Python program can be run with "python3 main.py".
It will print a report of words and characters for "frankenstein.txt".
